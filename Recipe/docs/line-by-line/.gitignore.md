File: .gitignore
Purpose: Defines files and folders that Git should ignore. This version appears misconfigured because it lists project-critical files (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.gitignore`) which would normally be committed.

At a glance: Contains four lines instructing Git to ignore the manifest files and `node_modules`.

Imports & dependencies: N/A.

Configuration/Constants:
- `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, `.gitignore` are patterns to ignore—flagged in `docs/COVERAGE_REPORT.md` as potential issues.
- `/node_modules` prevents committing installed dependencies.

Main content:
- The patterns are evaluated by Git for every commit. Because the file ignores itself, the ignore rule will not apply retroactively to the tracked copy, but future clones may behave unexpectedly if developers rely on this file to manage ignores.

Edge cases & errors:
- Ignoring `package.json` can break installs on clean clones. Recommend correcting in future PRs.
